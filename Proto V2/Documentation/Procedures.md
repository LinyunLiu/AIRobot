When testing the robot indoors
- Robot is off ground and motors are free to move without touching anything
- Robot is plugged in so that it can charge while in use
## Outdoors

- Verify you know what the robot will likely do with an [indoor](#indoors) test first
- Make sure the space is clear of people
- Always have someone nearby ready to hit the e-stop
