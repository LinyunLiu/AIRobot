# Welcome to TWU RRU
Hello and Welcome to the Trinity Western University Robotics Research Unit!
what is twu rru?

- provide a welcome to any new robotics lab researchers
- provide an introduction to the proto projects and their background (and provide a list of previous renditions as links and as archives)
- provide an introduction to proto v2 (this documentation and project)
## What is TWU RRU?

## Notes from Jacobus Burger (2024-09-08)
One of the big problems we had in the robotics lab for proto v1 was a lack of organization. Not a lack of management, the organic organizational structure was perfect, but it was lacking systems to realize the latent potential of the system, organization schemes and methods to keep everything well kept. So what I realize was needed was a knowledge base, better than the notion one we used before (though that was very helpful).
So this time around, I want to realize that potential by utilizing various organizational systems to keep everyone informed and organized with minimal friction and minimal effort.
- The system used to achieve this will be the [5S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5S_(methodology)) methodology
- [this method of labelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1QqAZeEfes&pp=ygUiaG93IGxhYmVscyBtdWx0aXBseSB5b3VyIGtub3dsZWRnZQ%3D%3D) is helpful to maintain a physical knowledge-base
- keep code organized and clean!
	- No temporary code in this repository
	- Always use virtual environments.
	- Keep code clean
	- Communicate and document (with this vault and git commit messages)

ensure explanations are provided, this should be great documentation to help any newcomers to the project. The structure of this should be simple enough for new users of the project and its future renditions to carry on after the pioneer team are gone.

meetings W 11:30am


some way for people to mark times when they're in so other people can understand what they did.
some way for people to mark times they're going to be in (on a calendar)
Who worked on what.
Source code.

Discord for communications.
Shared calendar for timing (and maybe a log-sheet for people to clock in when they're here and for how long)





- ask group if they're good to get the odrive s1 modules (and email park about it)
- finish the welcome, and make a summary of the previous workSummary of what the task is and what needs to be accomplished by i
