# Welcome to TWU RRU
你好/Hola/Hello/مرحبًا/नमस्ते and **WELCOME** to the Trinity Western University Robotics Research Unit (TWU RRU)!

We're always glad to have new contributors that are willing to learn and grow with us! The project may seem a bit overwhelming at first since there's so much involved in it, but this documentation and the kindness of our other contributors should help you get up to speed in no time at all! If you have any questions feel free to ask around!

## What is TWU RRU?
TWU RRU is a robotics research and development group at TWU who research and develop robotic systems across a host of [interdisciplinary areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_robotics) to solve useful and interesting problems.
The TWU RRU was started in April 2024 by PhD Andrew Park ([TWU Profile](https://www.twu.ca/profile/andrew-park) - [Email](A.Park@twu.ca)) out of an interest to develop helpful robotic automatons.

## Standards
### Expectations
As a contributor we expect the following from you:
- **Be communicative**. This is a group effort of all the contributors, so write documentation in the right directories in this documentation system as you go, and meet with people, and chat! Let people know what you're doing, what you've done, and more so that we can all pick up and put down work in this common space we share!
- **Be a learner**. We're here to learn as we go through the project and to learn from one another. You'll find a lot of things you don't have a lot of experience with, be free to ask questions and do research and share what you learn as you go! Don't be afraid to ask questions or try things out!
- **Bring yourself**. We want all your experiences, your perspectives, your ideas, and your personality. All contributors are equal with each-other and we all add our unique qualities to the RRU towards the completion of the projects!
As a contributor you are free to contribute in whatever way you would like to and do whatever you would like to, subject to the above principles (like communicating and getting approval first where needed), but otherwise the RRU operates organically and fluidly, to adapt to all the interesting processes and problems!

### Coding
Software is the most prone to becoming messy without good standards to follow, so stick to these principles as much as possible:
- keep code organized and clean!
	- **NO TEMPORARY CODE** in this repository (if it cannot be avoided, then do it in the 'temp' directory, but please don't make a mess of the codebase like that)!
	- Always use virtual environments and other forms of versioning control to keep software environments as portable as possible.
	- Keep code clean
	- Communicate and document
		- code comments
		- notes
		- git commit messages

### Safety
Please see [Procedures](Procedures.md).

### Behaviour
It's important to treat each other well and welcome people to the RRU so that it can continue to thrive through the common joy we all share for robotics! So we follow these principles in our interactions with one another to foster that culture of kindness, community, and collaboration:
- He loves us, so let us **love one another**.
- Remember that **all people are people**, so don't exclude anyone and don't view anyone as superior/inferior to anyone else.
- **Be welcoming** to all interested participants, *no one is born a roboticist*.

## Organizational Scheme - Jacobus Burger (2024-09-08)
One of the big problems we had in the robotics lab for proto v1 was a lack of organization. Not a lack of management, the leaderless organizational structure was perfect, but it was lacking systems to realize the latent potential of the system, organization schemes and methods to facilitate dynamic collaboration between team members. So what I realize was needed was a knowledge base, better than the notion one we used before (though that was very helpful).
That is why this [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) documentation is used this time around! By utilizing various organizational systems to keep everyone informed and organized with minimal friction and minimal effort, we're able to facilitate a dynamic and adaptive environment for contributions!
- The system used to achieve this is the [5S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5S_(methodology)) organizational system.
- The video ["How labels multiply your knowledgebase, cash, time, on LOW effort."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1QqAZeEfes) goes into detail on how this approach is done.
- You may have already observed some factor of it in the Data Assimilation Laboratory (One area is marked off with green tape as "TA Area", another as "RRU", and another as "Common Area" with physical seperators like bookshelves to create a deliniation between different areas and their uses).

#  How to use this documentation
## Setup
1. Install [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) on your device
2. clone this github repository
3. open this "Documentation" folder (the root of the docs) in Obsidian
4. Say yes to Trust when prompted so all plugins can be installed and activated

## Use
If templater plugin is setup correctly, then creating a new file in the respective folder should automatically trigger the corresponding template for that note.

## Index
Each day please write a progress report in [Progress](Reports/Progress/Progress.md).
If you have any ideas, put them in [Ideas](Ideas.md).
If you find any helpful guides, tutorials, or other resources, put them in [Resources](Resources/Resources.md).
If you find any academic papers or resources using [Zoterro](https://www.zotero.org/), then put them in [Research](Research/Research.md).
Please follow protocols/procedures and add any as needed in [Procedures](Procedures.md).
If you do any tests, write a report in [Tests](Reports/Tests/Tests.md).
If any incidents occur (like robot going into walls, injuring people, etc), write an [Incidents](Reports/Incidents/Incidents.md) report.
**TODO's** and other project/task management is handled with the [Tasks Overview](Project/Tasks%20Overview.md) kanban board. Just add tasks as needed, a date for the task, and if you need to go into more detail you can right-click a task card and make it into a note (template will automatically handle it).
