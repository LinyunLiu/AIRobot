# Overview
Today I set up the Router `airobot_router` and setup RPI4 to connect to it by default (give it 3m after boot). I also setup and ran a [vel_control demo](Reports/Tests/vel_control%20demo.md) test for the motor modules to ensure everything is working nominally in the motor control system.
Future plans need to move from the ESC-style motor control system we have right now towards an FOC one like [ODrive](https://shop.odriverobotics.com/products/odrive-pro).
