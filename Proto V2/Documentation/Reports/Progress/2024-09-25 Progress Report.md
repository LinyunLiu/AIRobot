# Overview
Today I expanded on documentation and added some new "domains" like [Q&A](Resources/Q&A.md). I also worked to setup remote desktop.

## Details
- Added additional information to [Proto V1 Motor Control System Overview](Archive/Proto%20V1%20Motor%20Control%20System%20Overview.md) about e-stop behaviour.
- Added [Q&A](Resources/Q&A.md) for any questions people may ask.
- Updated [Welcome](Welcome.md) page.
- Added nice icons to folders for visual feedback
- Setup Remote Desktop for RPI4.
