# Overview
Wrote more documentation to make onboarding easier. The majority was just summarizing the previous project ([Proto V1](Archive/Proto%20V1/Proto%20V1.md)).

## Details
- Dr Park introduced the screen and input devices for the RPI4, but there wasn't a way to connect the display to the RPI4. So [Setup Remote Desktop for RPi4](Project/Tasks/Setup%20Remote%20Desktop%20for%20RPi4.md) will be done next week either Monday or Wednesday at the earliest.
- I wrote a [ROS 2 Overview](Resources/Info/ROS%202%20Overview.md) to help introduce the software stack we're using in this project.
- I wrote [Proto V1](Archive/Proto%20V1/Proto%20V1.md) and all its connected notes to give an overview of previous work.
- I wrote a summary about myself, [Jacobus Burger](People/Jacobus%20Burger.md).
