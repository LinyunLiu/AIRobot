# Overview
Progress was slow for the last few weeks, but we met up today and chose to get the [ODrive S1](https://shop.odriverobotics.com/products/odrive-s1?variant=40926827872326) from [ODrive](Resources/ODrive.md) for FOC control and a better motor control system.

Our reasons were numerous
- servo-like control
- versatile applications
- precise position and speed controls
- ease of use
Among many many others.
