[ROS 2 - Humble Hawksbill](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) is the underlying infrastructure upon which the robotic system is built. This was an intentional design decision to avoid having to write an entire concurrent control system middleware from scratch. ROS2 is a well-known and well-supported robot automation framework with countless plugins/modules to support and automate most of the busywork of getting a robot up and running, and it's flexible enough to be adapted to your particular needs in any project.

ROS2 is an industry strandard and a favourite among hobbyists. You can read more at [Why ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/_downloads/2a9c64e08982f3709e23d20e5dc9f294/ros2-brochure-ltr-web.pdf).
